# A Hip-Hop Timeline

I collected a large list of names from wikipedia. As I started researching (aka watching videos, listening to interviews), I started learning about more rappers. Google "the first female mc" and you'll find a lot of different opinions. It wasn't until I listened to a [Kool Herc interview](https://soundcloud.com/thecombatjackshow/the-kool-herc-episode) that I discovered Pebblee Poo, MC Smiley and Sweet and Sour. Finding documentation and early releases by those artists has been pretty difficult. That's because hip hop started as a live performance (MC and DJ) art. It wasn't until battles started picking up that people started recording live performances.

Elements of D3 I recently learned to do this:
* d3.time.scale()
* .nest()
* .each(function(){})
* .on("mouseenter", function(){})
* .classed("class", true/false) for toggling classes
* .transition()
